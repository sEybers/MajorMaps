# MajorMap

**MajorMap** is a web application designed to help students navigate their academic paths with ease. By entering their major and completed classes, users can generate a structured roadmap that visually represents their progress and estimated graduation timeline. MajorMap provides a unique "what-if" feature, allowing students to explore future semesters with planned courses and see a semester-by-semester breakdown of their academic journey.

## Features

- **Interactive Major Mapping**: Generate a visual map, similar to an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), that displays a structured pathway through your major.
- **Graduation Date Estimation**: Receive an estimated graduation date (e.g., "Fall 2028") based on completed and planned courses.
- **"What-If" Planning**: Explore potential future semesters by adding courses you plan to take and viewing a transcript-like history with both completed and planned coursework.
